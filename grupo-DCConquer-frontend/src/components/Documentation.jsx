          click one of the buttons in the navbar or go directly to the game by
          clicking the "join match as a guest" or "watch match" buttons. There's
          no interaction here with the backend, as no information is required or
          has been sent yet.

          {" "}
          Here the user can click one of the many options the navbar offers. You
          can press the DCConquer button to return to the home page, you can go
          to the "About" to get to know more about the DCConquer team, you can
          press the "Rules" button to read the main game rules, you can press

          press the "Documentation" button to get right here and finally you can
          sign up or log in as a user. The navbar will follow the user travel
          throughout the website and will not change unless the user has already
          logged in. In this case, the frontend will ask the backend the
          username to make it part of the navbar, changing the buttons "Sign Up"
          and "Log in" for "Profile - username" and "Log out".
        </h6>
        <h5> Backend </h5>
        <h6>
          The backend will give the navbar the user's username in order to put
          it up there as soon as the user has logged in.

        <h6>
          The user enters his/her email adress and password. As soon as the user
          clicks the button "Log in", the frontend sends the input's values to
          the backend and waits for permission to go on.
        </h6>
        <h5> Backend </h5>
        <h6>
          The backend recieves the user's email and password and checks in the
          database if they are registered. If the credentials aren't valid, the
          backend sends to the frontend a message of access denied because of
          wrong email or password. Otherwise, the backend sends a message to the
          frontend welcoming the user and allowing him/her to go on.

        {/* aca va el sign up (antes cards) */}
        <h3>Sign Up</h3>
        <h5>Frontend</h5>
        <h6>
          The user enters his/her real name, email, password, nickname and picks
          an avatar. This information will go to the backend to save the
          registration in the database. As soon as the user has entered the
          information, the frontend will start waiting for the backend's
          response.
        </h6>
        <h5>Backend</h5>
        <h6>
          The backend will check if the user's information is alright (for
          example, if the nickname is already taken). If everything is fine, it
          will asign the user an id and will save the information in the
          database. Then it will send the welcoming message and will allow
          him/her to go on as well. If there's a problem, the backend will deny
          the access and will send a message explaining what went wrong.

          This button will send a non-registered user to a page where he/she
          will be able to join a match. The button itself just redirects the
          user to another view, so there's no interaction frontend - backend.

          will be able to watch a match. The button itself just redirects the

        <h6>
          The backend will recieve the match information and will check if
          everything it's in order. Then, it will save the party in the database
          and send the message of allowance to the frontend. It will be

          In first place, once the user enters this view, the backend will send
          to the frontend all the available matches. When the backend receives
          the information of the user trying to join a specific match, it will
          check if there's still room in it. Then, if everything is allright,
          the backend will register the user to the match and will give him/her
          access to the match waiting room.

          redirect to a page that will show all the relevant personal
          information of the user. This data will be provided by the backend, so

        <h6>
          Once the host user enters his/her waiting room, the frontend will show
          each player that has joined. This information will be provided by the
          backend, which will be actively listening if a player is trying to get
          in. The host user will be able to leave the match by pressing the
          "Leave Match" button, also will be able to accept/reject a player who
          is trying to enter the waiting room and kick them out once they are
          in. Every action the user does will be sent to the backend in order to
          manage the party development. Finally, when the host user wants to,
          he/she can start the game by pressing "Start" button.
        </h6>
        <h5>Backend</h5>

          waiting room, if he/she's accepted/rejected/kicked out and if the
          match starts. For every action, the backend will be sending the

        <h3>Waiting Room (Guest view)</h3>
        <h5>Frontend</h5>
        <h6>
          To get into the waiting room, the frontend will wait for the backend
          allowance. Once the player enters a waiting room, the frontend will
          show each player that has joined. This information will be provided by
          the backend, which will be actively listening if a player is trying to
          get in. The player will be able to leave the match by pressing the
          "Leave Match" button. The player will have to wait until the host user
          starts the match.
        </h6>
        <h5>Backend</h5>
        <h6>
          The backend will listen when a player wants to enter the waiting room,
          so it will send to the frontend a question if the host user accepts or
          rejects the incoming player. If the frontend information shows that
          the host accepted the new player, the backend will register him/her
          into the match database and will send the allowance to the frontend.

        <h6>
          Once inside a match, the players will be able to do many actions. In
          their respective turns, each player will be able to throw the dices,
          pick cards, move troops, build walls and ships, attack and defend
          their territories, etc. The frontend will be recieving information
          about which movements the player can do. All the turn information will
          be sent at the end of itself to the backend, so in the next turn every
          player will know what happened.
        </h6>
        <h5>Backend</h5>
        <h6>
          The backend will send the turn options to the respective user in
          his/her turn. At the same time, will be recieving the turn information
          and, when the backend gets the signal of "next turn", it will send to
          the frontend all the effects of the turn that has just happened. Then,
          each player will see what happened and the next turn will be assigned.

          The espectator will be just seeing the changes once a turn ends, so
          there's not going to be any other frontend interaction more than
          leaving the match. There is not going to be frontend-backend
          interaction more than the one happening inside the game.
